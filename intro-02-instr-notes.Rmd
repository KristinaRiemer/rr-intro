## R is for Reproducibility

**Why R?**
* Programming language for data analysis
* Free!
* Open source
* Widely used and supported across all disciplines
* Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux

Show the learners a screen shot of R running from the terminal. Perhaps show
that it is an overgrown calculator:

**Why not language X?**
* There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also
be used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis
* The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate
and document your analysis
* Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another
* Might ask learners what programming languages they already know with a show of
  hands for...
  * R
  * Python
  * Perl
  * SQL
  * Java
  * C/C++
* It would be good to jot down numbers to store as "data" for later usage.



**You could just type into the command prompt...**
* ... but that doesn't help much with documentation
* ... but that doesn't help much with automation


**A better solution**

With RStudio you can combine your programming and your documentation
* RStudio gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your
analysis
* It runs on top of R
* Gives you a bunch of really cool features that we'll explore throughout the
workshop
* Show the learners a screen shot of R running from the terminal. Perhaps replicate that it is an overgrown calculator and orient them to the different panes in the environment:

## Summary
Let's summarize what we've learned:
* First and foremost, we learned that everyone struggles with reproducibility
  and that it is a hindrance to moving science forward

* We focused on 4 problems: organization, documentation, automation, and
  dissemination with a fairly simple analysis. Over the next two days, our
  project will become more complex as we gather more data and ask more
  complicated questions.

* In discussing:
  * ***Organization*** you will be given tools to organize your projects
    so that you don't have a single folder with hundreds of files
  * ***Documentation*** you will learn the difference between binary files
    (e.g. docx) and text files and why text files are preferred using a simple
    tool called markdown that you can use to write descriptions of your data and
    your workflow so that anyone can pick up your data and understand what you
    are doing
  * ***Automation*** you will learn about the power of scripting in the R
    programming language and how you can integrate that into markdown to create
    automated data analyses
  * ***Dissemination*** you will see that publishing is not the end of your
    analysis. Rather it is a way station towards your future research and the
    future research of others.

* Finally, throughout the workshop we will give you a rubric that you can use to
  assess the likelihood that you analysis can be reproduced by others
