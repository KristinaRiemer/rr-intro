# Reproduciblility toolkit

## R + RStudio

<div class="columns-2">

</div>


## Why R?

<div class="columns-2">
- Programming language for data analysis
- Free!
- Open source
- Widely used and supported across all disciplines
- Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux

## Why not language X?

- There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be 
used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis

- The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate and 
document your analysis

- Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another

## Why RStudio?

<div class="columns-2">
- Runs on top of R
- Single environment for documentation and analysis with markdown support
- Bunch of really cool features that we'll explore throughout the workshop

## Anatomy of RStudio

<div class="columns-2">
- Left: Console
    - Text on top at launch: version of R that youâ€™re running
    - Below that is the prompt
- Upper right: Workspace and command history
- Lower right: Plots, access to files, help, packages, data viewer

## R Packages

- Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R
functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and (often) sample data.
(From: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)

- We will use the `ggplot2` package for plots and `dplyr` for data wrangling in this
session.

- If you have not yet done so, install these packages by running the following
in the Console:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```
    
- This is just one way of installing a package, there is also a GUI approach in 
the Packages pane
