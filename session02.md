## R is for Reproduciblity

--- &twocol

## R

***{name: left}
* Programming language for data analysis
* Free!
* Open source
* Widely used and supported across all disciplines
* Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux

## Why not this other language?

* There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also
be used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis
* The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate
and document your analysis
* Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another

*** =pnotes
* Might ask learners what programming languages they already know

--- 

## You could just type into the command prompt...

> * but that doesn't help much with documentation

## Combine your programming and your documentation with RStudio

<img src="img/RStudioSplash.png" alt="RStudio Splash Screen", style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="700">

*** =pnotes
* RStudio gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your
	analysis
* It runs on top of R
* Gives you a bunch of really cool features that we'll explore throughout the
	workshop
