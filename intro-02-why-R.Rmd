## R is for Reproducibility

**Why R?**

* Programming language for data analysis
* Free!
* Open source
* Widely used and supported across all disciplines
* Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux

Show the learners a screen shot of R running from the terminal. Perhaps show
that it is an overgrown calculator:

**Why not language X?**

* There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also
be used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis
* The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate
and document your analysis
* Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another
* Might ask learners what programming languages they already know with a show of
  hands for...
  * R
  * Python
  * Perl
  * SQL
  * Java
  * C/C++
* It would be good to jot down numbers to store as "data" for later usage.



**You could just type into the command prompt...**

* ... but that doesn't help much with documentation
* ... but that doesn't help much with automation


**A better solution**

With RStudio you can combine your programming and your documentation

* RStudio gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your
analysis
* It runs on top of R
* Gives you a bunch of really cool features that we'll explore throughout the
workshop
* Show the learners a screen shot of RStudio and review the panes
