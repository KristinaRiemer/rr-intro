If anyone sees improvements that can be made to this, add to or change whatever as you see fit. 

## Notes

The Software Carpentry pre-workshop survey was used as inspiration and can be found [here] (https://docs.google.com/a/weecology.org/forms/d/1375KdWmSu2a6ZqU2xAfozlNJydFaZpoM2HXw60cDioo/viewform). The first few questions are directly from the survey. 

My advisor said that SW Carpentry gets good survey participation rates by telling participants in the email containing the survey that they have to take the survey to confirm their spot in the workshop. That's something that we could possibly do also.
