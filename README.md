## Intro sessions:

At the beginning of this workshop, participants should be able to

- use a spreadsheet program to generate a plot
- use a text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) to communicate

At the end of the intro sessions students will be able to 

- recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address 
- identify pain points in getting their analysis to be reproducible.

The specific problems to be addresses in each session are as follows:

- Session 1: documentation and sharing
- Session 2: automation and organization

The second session will also introduce them to some tools that can be used to solve these 
problems, specifically R/RStudio/RMarkdown.

## Session 1:

### Pre-workshop

Participants install R+RStudio

TO DO: See the Intro Session 1 materials to decide if instructions for R+RStudio installation are good enough or if they should be updated

### Intro

- Welcome + go over schedule
- TO DO: See the case study wiki page at https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/wiki/Irreproducible-Examples, and decide if any more instructors notes need to be developed to help instructors choose and discuss one or a few of these quickly.

### Ex 1: Naive reproducibility

Data analysis task + share/reproduce + discuss. Outline is in the instructor notes (`intro-01-instr-notes.Rmd`).

TO DO: Reproducibility checklist is at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/s4QrwICsxr. This still needs to be finalized intro a pre-workshop survey form, and more instructor notes may need to be developed to insert in the instructors note here.

## Coffee break:

Catch everyone up with R/RStudio instructions

## Session 2:

Provide RMarkdown approach to what's done in Session 1 (intro-01-template.Rmd), and then demonstrate how an approach based on executable scripts and self documenting code makes it easier to automate, organize, and extend our analyses.  Outline can be found in the instructor notes (`intro-02-instr-notes.Rmd`).

* TODO: Align session 1 and session 2 materials to remove redundancies, use common language/syntax.
