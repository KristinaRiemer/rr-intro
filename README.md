## Intro sessions:

At the beginning of this workshop, participants should be able to

- use a spreadsheet program to generate a plot
- use a text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) to communicate

At the end of the intro sessions students will be able to 

- recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address 
- identify pain points in getting their analysis to be reproducible.

The specific problems to be addresses in each session are as follows:

- Session 1: documentation and sharing
- Session 2: automation and organization

The second session will also introduce them to some tools that can be used to solve these 
problems, specifically R/RStudio/RMarkdown.

## Session 1:

### Pre-workshop

Participants install R+RStudio

TO DO: See the Intro Session 1 materials to decide if instructions for R+RStudio installation are good enough or if they should be updated

### Intro

- Welcome + go over schedule
- TO DO: See the case study wiki page at https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/wiki/Irreproducible-Examples, and decide if any more instructors notes need to be developed to help instructors choose and discuss one or a few of these quickly

### Ex 1: Naive reproducibility

Data analysis task + share/reproduce + discuss. Outline is in the instructor notes.

TO DO: Reproducibility checklist is at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/s4QrwICsxr. This still needs to be finalized intro a pre-workshop survey form, and more instructor notes may need to be developed to insert in the instructors note here.

## Coffee break:

Catch everyone up with R/RStudio instructions

## Session 2:

Provide RMarkdown approach to what's done in Session 1, and then demonstrate how this approach makes automation and organization easier.

TO DO: Align session 1 and session 2 materials to remove redundancies, use common language/syntax.
