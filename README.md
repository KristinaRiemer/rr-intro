rr-intro
========

## Intro sessions:

At the beginning of this workshop, participants should be able to

- use a spreadsheet program to generate a plot
- use a text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) to communicate

At the end of the intro sessions students will be able to 

- recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address 
- identify pain points in getting their analysis to be reproducible.

The specific problems to be addresses in each session are as follows:

- Session 1: documentation and sharing
- Session 2: automation and organization

The second session will also introduce them to some tools that can be used to solve these 
problems, specifically R/RStudio/RMarkdown.

## Session 1:

### Prereq

TO DO: Good installation instructions for R/RStudio for Mac and PC (Tracy)

- TO DO: Choose a case study that the instructor presents to motivate the audience. (Dave)
Options:
    - Francis Collins - Nature: http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-plans-to-enhance-reproducibility-1.14586    
    - Retraction watch might be a good place to find options

### Ex 1: Naive reproducibility

Data analysis task + share/reproduce + discuss. Outline is in the instructor notes.

TO DO: Create subsets of the dataset to go with each task. (Mine)

TO DO: Running what we've done through the reproducibility checklist. (Billy)

## Coffee break:

Catch everyone up with R/RStudio instructions

## Session 2:

TO DO: Create subset for the remaining data (Mine)

TO DO: Create an RMarkdown file that contains the code/annotation/narrative for everything happening in this session. 
This will serve as the template for the exercises. (Paul + Mine)

TO DO: Develop the exercises and write the accompanying instructor notes (Paul)
